# Visualizing change over time

## The basics

So far, we've talked about bar charts -- normal or waffle -- are good for showing relative size of a thing compared to another thing. Waffle charts are good at showing proportions of a whole. 

**Line charts are good for showing change over time.** 

Let's revisit some data we've used in the past and turn it into charts.

```{r load-tidyverse, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```
```{r load-tidyverse-solution}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```
```{r load-tidyverse-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Let's work on some examples using the UNLPD reports data. You can download the data here if you want to use it in your own notebook -- and this is the same data we've used before, so if you already downloaded it, you don't need to do it again. **For purposes of this exercise, you don't need to do this. The data is included here if you want to try this in your own notebook.**

```{r echo=FALSE, class.output="bg-info", results="asis",  message=FALSE,  warning=FALSE}
library(downloadthis)
library(glue)

dllink <- download_link(
  link = "https://mattwaite.github.io/datajournalismfiles/crimelogs.csv",
  button_label = "Download csv file",
  button_type = "danger",
  has_icon = TRUE,
  icon = "fa fa-save",
  self_contained = FALSE
)

glue("<pre><p><strong>For this walkthrough:</strong></p><p>{dllink}</p></pre>")

```

Now import the data.

```{r chart-load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crimes <- read_csv("http://mattwaite.github.io/datajournalismfiles/crimelogs.csv")

weed <- crimes |> 
  filter(incident_code == "NARCOTICS - POSSESSION") |>
  mutate(month = floor_date(mdy_hm(reported), unit="months")) |>
  group_by(month, incident_code) |>
  summarize(
    count = n()
  )

beernweed <- crimes |> 
  filter(
    incident_code == "ALCOHOL - MINOR IN POSSESSION" |
    incident_code == "ALCOHOL - DRUNK" |
    incident_code == "NARCOTICS - POSSESSION"
    ) |>
  mutate(month = floor_date(mdy_hm(reported), unit="months")) |>
  group_by(month, incident_code) |>
  summarize(
    count = n()
  )
```
```{r chart-load-data-exercise, exercise = TRUE}
crimes <- read_csv("http://mattwaite.github.io/datajournalismfiles/crimelogs.csv")
```
```{r chart-load-data-exercise-solution}
crimes <- read_csv("http://mattwaite.github.io/datajournalismfiles/crimelogs.csv")
```
```{r chart-load-data-exercise-check}
grade_this_code()
```

## Line charts

Line charts show change over time. It works the much the same as a bar chart, code wise, but instead of a weight, it uses a y. And if you have more than one group in your data, it takes a group element.

The first secret to knowing if you have a line chart is if you have data that changes over time. The second secret to making a line chart is your x value is almost always a date. If it's not an actual date, it's a thing like a date -- a year, a season, a semester, something with date elements in it. 

Let's look at how drug possession incidents have changed over time at the university. First thing we'll do is create a dataframe. Because we have worked with this data before, and individual days are too many to work with since we have data covering 5 years, we'll collapse them down to months. We've done this before -- we'll use lubridate and floor_date. We'll call the dataframe `weed` because that's what most of the drug possession cases are on campus. 

### Exercise 1: Making some data

```{r line1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "chart-load-data"}
____ <- crimes |> 
  filter(incident_code == "NARCOTICS - POSSESSION") |>
  mutate(month = ____(mdy_hm(reported), unit="months")) |>
  group_by(month, incident_code) |>
  summarize(
    count = n()
  )
```
```{r line1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
weed <- crimes |> 
  filter(incident_code == "NARCOTICS - POSSESSION") |>
  mutate(month = floor_date(mdy_hm(reported), unit="months")) |>
  group_by(month, incident_code) |>
  summarize(
    count = n()
  )
```
```{r line1-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Now, with our weed dataframe, we have three columns to work with. You can see them looking at the first six rows with `head`.

```{r line2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "chart-load-data"}
head(weed)
```
```{r line2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
head(weed)
```
```{r line2-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 2: Your first line chart

As you can see, we have three columns to work with: month, incident_code and count. We have what we need to make a line chart -- a date-like thing and a number. From those three, we need to fill in the x, the y. 

```{r line3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "chart-load-data"}
ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data=____, aes(x=____, y=____))
```
```{r line3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data=weed, aes(x=month, y=count))
```
```{r line3-check}
grade_this_code()
```

So what story does this tell? Looks like before the pandemic, students around here were really into the jazz cabbage, and that fell off in 2019. It's been low, historically, since then and remained there. A question you can only answer with reporting: Is it because today's students are straight-edge and no one is using weed? Or is because edibles are so much more prevalent now people aren't getting caught? Or is it because of Delta-8 being "legal", and it's harder to tell the difference? All good questions to ask experts. 

But a one-line line chart is usually not a line chart. At least, not a very good one. It doesn't tell a complete of a story as it could. We need more to compare to. 

### Exercise 3: A wild weekend

Let's make a new dataframe called `beernweed`. It's going to be a dataframe of two alcohol and one drug related incident codes that are in the top 10 of reported incidents. We're then going to make a `month` column which is a floor date of the reported column. Then, we'll count up how many of those incidents happened in each month.  

```{r line4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "chart-load-data"}
____ <- crimes |> 
  filter(
    incident_code == "ALCOHOL - MINOR IN POSSESSION" |
    incident_code == "ALCOHOL - DRUNK" |
    incident_code == "NARCOTICS - POSSESSION"
    ) |>
  mutate(____ = floor_date(mdy_hm(reported), unit="months")) |>
  group_by(month, incident_code) |>
  summarize(
    count = n()
  )
```
```{r line4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
beernweed <- crimes |> 
  filter(
    incident_code == "ALCOHOL - MINOR IN POSSESSION" |
    incident_code == "ALCOHOL - DRUNK" |
    incident_code == "NARCOTICS - POSSESSION"
    ) |>
  mutate(month = floor_date(mdy_hm(reported), unit="months")) |>
  group_by(month, incident_code) |>
  summarize(
    count = n()
  )
```
```{r line4-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Now we'll make a line chart out of this data. From our beernweed dataframe, you have three columns to work with again: `month`, `incident_code` and `count`. This time, however, because we have three incident codes, and we want a line from each, we need to do more. We need to add a group element and a color element. The group element will make one line for each thing you put in there, and the color will help us see which is which. 

### Exercise 4: Making lines

```{r line5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "chart-load-data"}
ggplot() + 
  geom_line(
    data=____, 
    aes(
      x=____, 
      y=____, 
      group=_________, 
      color=_________
      )
    )
```
```{r line5-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_line(
    data=beernweed, 
    aes(
      x=month, 
      y=count, 
      group=incident_code, 
      color=incident_code
      )
    )
```
```{r line5-check}
grade_this_code()
```

And what do we learn from this? Looks like campus was a much wilder place before the pandemic. COVID tamped down on police calls for alcohol and drugs. But, it looks like alcohol calls are trending back up again.
