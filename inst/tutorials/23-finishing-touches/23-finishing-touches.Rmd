## The Goal

In this lesson, you'll learn how to apply professional finishing touches to your data visualizations. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to enhance the readability and visual appeal of your charts through strategic use of themes, text formatting, and layout adjustments. You'll practice customizing titles, subtitles, axes, and other chart elements to create polished, publication-ready graphics. These skills will enable you to present your data journalism projects with a level of professionalism that meets industry standards.

## The Basics

The output from ggplot is good, but not great. We need to add some pieces to it. The elements of a good graphic are:

* Headline
* Chatter
* The main body
* Annotations
* Labels
* Source line
* Credit line

That looks like:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/chartannotated.png"))
```

Let's explore fixing up ggplot's output. We'll need a graphic to work with first, so I'm going to use the bar chart we just made with drug calls on campus in the Color chapter plus some of the work we did in the Annotations chapter. 

```{r finishing-load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crimes <- read_csv("http://mattwaite.github.io/datajournalismfiles/crimelogs.csv")

top20 <- crimes |> 
  group_by(incident_code) |>
  summarize(
    count = n()
  ) |>
  ungroup() |>
  top_n(20, wt=count)

drugs <- top20 |> filter(grepl("NARCOTICS", incident_code) == TRUE)
```

```{r finishing1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "finishing-load-data", message=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="lightgrey") + 
  geom_bar(data=drugs, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="darkgreen") +    
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    x="", 
    y="UNL police calls 2018-2023", 
    title="Drug possession second most UNLPD call", 
    subtitle="According to an analysis of data, drugs and alcohol are most often the reason university police get called.", 
    caption="Source: University Police | By Your Name"
    )
```
```{r finishing1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="lightgrey") + 
  geom_bar(data=drugs, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="darkgreen") +    
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    x="", 
    y="UNL police calls 2018-2023", 
    title="Drug possession second most UNLPD call", 
    subtitle="According to an analysis of data, drugs and alcohol are most often the reason university police get called.", 
    caption="Source: University Police | By Your Name"
    )
```
```{r finishing1-check}
grade_this_code()
```

The first thing you should do with any chart that isn't a waffle chart -- more on that later -- is remove the default plot look and grey backgound by adding a pre-defined theme. There are two you should use to clean your charts up: `theme_minimal` or `theme_light`. These pre-packaged themes do just that. They make your chart cleaner and easier to read in one swoop. 

**NOTE**: Adding a `theme()` is something you do last. And if you're going to change theme elements, you need to **apply your prepackaged theme first**, then do your theme customization. Everything in ggplot is rendered in order. If you do custom theming, THEN apply the prepackaged theme, the prepackaged theme will overwrite anything you did. So `theme_minimal()` or `theme_light()` comes first.

Scroll down here and find the theme_minimal() at the very end. We're just adding it on, like any other part of ggplot.

```{r finishing2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "finishing-load-data", message=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="lightgrey") + 
  geom_bar(data=drugs, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="darkgreen") +    
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    x="", 
    y="UNL police calls 2018-2023", 
    title="Drug possession second most UNLPD call", 
    subtitle="According to an analysis of data, drugs and alcohol are most often the reason university police get called.", 
    caption="Source: University Police | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r finishing2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="lightgrey") + 
  geom_bar(data=drugs, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="darkgreen") +    
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    x="", 
    y="UNL police calls 2018-2023", 
    title="Drug possession second most UNLPD call", 
    subtitle="According to an analysis of data, drugs and alcohol are most often the reason university police get called.", 
    caption="Source: University Police | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r finishing2-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Compare that to your previous chart. Easier to read, right?

We're off to a good start, but our text has no real hierarchy. We want our headline to stand out more. So let's change that. When it comes to changing text, the place to do that is in the theme element. [There are a lot of ways to modify the theme](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html). 

### Exercise 1: Bigger and bolder.

We'll start easy. Let's make the headline bigger -- size 20 -- and bold. Scroll down here under theme_minimal and you'll see where this happens.

```{r finishing3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "finishing-load-data", message=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="lightgrey") + 
  geom_bar(data=drugs, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="darkgreen") +    
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    x="", 
    y="UNL police calls 2018-2023", 
    title="Drug possession second most UNLPD call", 
    subtitle="According to an analysis of data, drugs and alcohol are most often the reason university police get called.", 
    caption="Source: University Police | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = ____, face = "____")
    ) 
```
```{r finishing3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="lightgrey") + 
  geom_bar(data=drugs, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="darkgreen") +    
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    x="", 
    y="UNL police calls 2018-2023", 
    title="Drug possession second most UNLPD call", 
    subtitle="According to an analysis of data, drugs and alcohol are most often the reason university police get called.", 
    caption="Source: University Police | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold")
    ) 
```
```{r finishing3-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Now let's fix a few other things -- like the axis labels being too big, the subtitle could be smaller and lets drop some grid lines. Let's make the subtitle 10, the axis labels 8. Scroll down and take a look.

### Exercise 2: More text heirarchy.

```{r finishing4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "finishing-load-data", message=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="lightgrey") + 
  geom_bar(data=drugs, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="darkgreen") +    
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    x="", 
    y="UNL police calls 2018-2023", 
    title="Drug possession second most UNLPD call", 
    subtitle="According to an analysis of data, drugs and alcohol are most often the reason university police get called.", 
    caption="Source: University Police | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = ____, face = "____"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = ____), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=____), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
    ) 
```
```{r finishing4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="lightgrey") + 
  geom_bar(data=drugs, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="darkgreen") +    
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    x="", 
    y="UNL police calls 2018-2023", 
    title="Drug possession second most UNLPD call", 
    subtitle="According to an analysis of data, drugs and alcohol are most often the reason university police get called.", 
    caption="Source: University Police | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
    ) 
```
```{r finishing4-check}
grade_this_code()
```

One last thing: ggplot, by default, sets the margin for the title and subtitle to the edge of the chart area -- the area were the data appears. It creates an odd spacing where the title is shifted right for little reason. We can fix that too in `theme()` by making the plot.title.position set to the plot. 

### Exercise 3: Fixing the indent

```{r finishing5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "finishing-load-data", message=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="lightgrey") + 
  geom_bar(data=drugs, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="darkgreen") +    
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    x="", 
    y="UNL police calls 2018-2023", 
    title="Drug possession second most UNLPD call", 
    subtitle="According to an analysis of data, drugs and alcohol are most often the reason university police get called.", 
    caption="Source: University Police | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = ____, face = "____"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = ____), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=____), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    plot.title.position = "____"
    ) 
```
```{r finishing5-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="lightgrey") + 
  geom_bar(data=drugs, aes(x=reorder(incident_code, count), weight=count), fill="darkgreen") +    
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    x="", 
    y="UNL police calls 2018-2023", 
    title="Drug possession second most UNLPD call", 
    subtitle="According to an analysis of data, drugs and alcohol are most often the reason university police get called.", 
    caption="Source: University Police | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    plot.title.position = "plot"
    ) 
```
```{r finishing5-check}
grade_this_code()
```

## Waffle charts require special attention

Frequently in my classes, students use the waffle charts library quite extensively to make graphics. This is a quick walkthough on how to get a waffle chart into a publication ready state. 

Let's look go back to the CoJMC waffle chart we did in the waffle tutorial. 

```{r waffle-load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
enrollment <- c("Advertising" = 436, "Broadcasting" = 118, "Journalism" = 107, "Sports Media" = 314)

cojmc <- c("Men" = 324, "Women" = 431, 2239)
cob <- c("Men" = 1890, "Women" = 1104)
```

We can add labels and themes, but you have to be careful. The waffle library is applying it's own theme -- like theme_minimal -- but if we override something they are using in their theme, some things that are hidden come back and make it worse. So here is an example of how to use ggplot's `labs` and the `theme` to make a fully publication ready graphic. They just get added with a + after the waffle.

```{r waffle1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "waffle-load-data", message=FALSE}
waffle(
        enrollment/10, 
        rows = 5, 
        title="COJMC majors", 
        xlab="1 square = 10 majors", 
        colors = c("#E41C38", "#045CB8", "#249C38", "#44DCB8")
) +
  labs(
    x = "1 square = 1 student",
    title="Advertising, sports COJMC's largest majors", 
    subtitle="Of the four majors in the college, journalism is the smallest.",
    caption="Source: UNL | Graphic by Matt Waite") + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  )
```
```{r waffle1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
waffle(
        enrollment/10, 
        rows = 5, 
        title="COJMC majors", 
        xlab="1 square = 10 majors", 
        colors = c("#E41C38", "#045CB8", "#249C38", "#44DCB8")
) +
  labs(
    x = "1 square = 1 student",
    title="Advertising, sports COJMC's largest majors", 
    subtitle="Of the four majors in the college, journalism is the smallest.",
    caption="Source: UNL | Graphic by Matt Waite") + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  )
```
```{r waffle1-check}
grade_this_code()
```

But what if we're using a waffle iron? It gets tougher. 

Here is a full example. I start with my waffle iron code, but note that each waffle is pretty much a self contained thing. That's because a waffle iron isn't really a thing. It's just a way to group waffles together, so you have to make each waffle individually. My first waffle has the title and subtitle and the x-axis label is the college. The bottom one has no title or subtitle but it does have the caption and the axis label has a little trick to add a return into the label, so I get both the team and the unit in there. 

```{r waffle2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "waffle-load-data", message=FALSE}
iron(
  waffle(
  cojmc/20,
  rows=5,
  title="COJMC gender breakdown", 
  xlab="1 square = 20 students",
  colors = c("orange", "green", "white")) + 
   labs(
     x="COJMC",
     title="COJMC vs COB: By the numbers", 
     subtitle="The gender balance in the two colleges is wildly different.") + 
   theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  ),
  waffle(
  cob/20,
  rows=5,
  title="COB gender breakdown", 
  xlab="1 square = 20 students",
  colors = c("orange", "green")) + 
   labs(
     x = "COB\n1 square = 20 students",
     caption="Source: UNL | Graphic by Matt Waite"
     )
) 
```
```{r waffle2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
iron(
  waffle(
  cojmc/20,
  rows=5,
  title="COJMC gender breakdown", 
  xlab="1 square = 20 students",
  colors = c("orange", "green", "white")) + 
   labs(
     x="COJMC",
     title="COJMC vs COB: By the numbers", 
     subtitle="The gender balance in the two colleges is wildly different.") + 
   theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  ),
  waffle(
  cob/20,
  rows=5,
  title="COB gender breakdown", 
  xlab="1 square = 20 students",
  colors = c("orange", "green")) + 
   labs(
     x = "COB\n1 square = 20 students",
     caption="Source: UNL | Graphic by Matt Waite"
     )
) 
```
```{r waffle2-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Note: These finishing touches aren't optional. They're required of every graphic you create going forward.

## The Recap

Throughout this lesson, you've mastered the art of refining your data visualizations for professional presentation. You've learned to apply clean themes, adjust text hierarchy, customize chart elements, and fine-tune layouts for both standard ggplot charts and waffle charts. Remember, these finishing touches are not just cosmetic - they're essential for effectively communicating your data story to your audience. As you continue your data journalism journey, always consider how these final adjustments can enhance the clarity and impact of your visualizations.

## Terms to Know

- Theme: A predefined set of visual parameters in ggplot2 that control the overall appearance of a chart.
- `element_text()`: A function used within theme() to modify text properties like size, color, and font face.
- `element_blank()`: A function used to remove chart elements entirely, such as gridlines.
- `plot.title`: The theme element that controls the appearance of the chart's main title.
- `plot.subtitle`: The theme element that controls the appearance of the chart's subtitle.
- `axis.title`: The theme element that controls the appearance of axis labels.
- `panel.grid`: The theme element that controls the appearance of gridlines in the chart.
- `plot.title.position`: A theme setting that adjusts the alignment of the chart title.
- `labs()`: A function in ggplot2 used to add or modify chart labels, including title, subtitle, and axis labels.
