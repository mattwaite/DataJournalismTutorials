# Visualizing your data with Datawrapper

Making charts in Datawrapper is preposterously simple. Making maps is less so, but not hard. 

## Data prep

Next, we need some data. **Start a notebook in your homework directory**, copy this block of code and run it: 

```
library(tidyverse)

predictions <- read_csv("https://mattwaite.github.io/datajournalismfiles/predictions.csv")

preds <- predictions |> filter(year == 2024) |>
  separate(coordinates, into=c("latitude", "longitude"), sep=",") 

write_csv(preds, "predictions.csv")
```

This block of code does a few things -- it pulls in the groundhog predictions data we've worked with, filters for just this last year and separates the latitude and longitude coordinates into separate columns. Then, using write_csv it writes the dataframe out to a csv file. It's the opposite of read_csv. 

After you run that, you'll have a csv file in your homework directory called predictions.csv. We'll use that for our datawrapper example. 

## Working in Datawrapper

In your Datawrapper dashboard, we want to start with a new chart. One thing Datawrapper does exceptionally well is create interactive maps. So let's make one.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper1.png"))
```

We're going to make a symbol map because our data is made up of points. Another very common map type is the Cholopleth map where each unit of geography is shaded in by the value.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper2.png"))
```

Our data includes points in Canada, so we want to select North America as our base map and then proceed.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper3.png"))
```

Here's where that work of creating the data comes in. Go find the predictions.csv file on your computer and add it here.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper4.png"))
```

We'll go to match and make sure Datawrapper found our latitude and longitude coordinates worked.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper5.png"))
```

We'll start with refining our map. We'll start to work with color palletes. You should change it to Step given that we're going to shade it by the shadow column -- which is only 1 or 0. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper6.png"))
```

Now we can fiddle with the legend to make it so instead of saying 1 or 0 it says late winter or early spring. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper7.png"))
```

Now we need to annotate our chart. We need a headline, some chatter (the description), the [data source](https://groundhog-day.com/) and a credit line. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper11.png"))
```

One great part of interactive maps are tooltips, where you can click on the dot and get information about it. So let's enable tooltips and customize them.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper9.png"))
```

You can always test what you see on the tooltips using the preview map on the right. Hover over a dot, see what it looks like.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper10.png"))
```

If you're happy with it, go on and proceed to the end. For credit for doing this, click the png button and upload that to Canvas.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper12.png"))
```
