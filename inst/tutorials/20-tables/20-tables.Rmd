## The Goal

In this lesson, you'll learn how to create informative and visually appealing tables using the gt package in R. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to structure data for table creation, customize table elements such as headers and labels, and apply styling to enhance readability. You'll practice these skills using real-world data on college majors, gaining practical experience in presenting complex information in a clear, tabular format. This ability to create professional-looking tables will be invaluable for effectively communicating data findings in your journalism projects.

## The Basics

A table is the most simple form of data presentation. Tables have been around for millenia. We've improved in them since, so we're not making a table. We're making a table with features. 

Sometimes, the best way to show your data is with a table -- simple rows and columns. It allows a reader to compare whatever they want to compare a little easier than a graph where you've chosen what to highlight. The folks that made R Studio and the tidyverse have a neat package called `gt`.

For this assignment, we'll need `gt`.

What does this library do? We need the tidyverse and gt to find out.

```{r load-tidyverse, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
```
```{r load-tidyverse-solution}
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
```
```{r load-tidyverse-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Let's just answer a curiosity question: What's the most common major at UNL? First, let's load a datafile I got from the university that breaks down majors by degree, major, race and sex.  

```{r table-load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
majors <- read_csv("https://mattwaite.github.io/datajournalismfiles/majors2023.csv")

topmajors <- majors |> top_n(20, wt=Total)
```
```{r table-load-data-exercise, exercise = TRUE}
majors <- read_csv("https://mattwaite.github.io/datajournalismfiles/majors2023.csv")
```
```{r table-load-data-exercise-solution}
majors <- read_csv("https://mattwaite.github.io/datajournalismfiles/majors2023.csv")
```
```{r table-load-data-exercise-check}
grade_this_code()
```

There's 182 majors at UNL. Far too many to put in a table. So let's start by making a top 20 list using `top_n` using the `Total` number of majors. We'll make a new dataframe and call it topmajors. 

### Exercise 1: Making a top 20 list.

```{r table1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "table-load-data", message=FALSE}
____ <- majors |> top_n(____, wt=____)
```
```{r table1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
topmajors <- majors |> top_n(20, wt=Total)
```
```{r table1-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Now, you can make a table with `gt` as simply as adding `gt()` after your dataframe. 

```{r table2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "table-load-data", message=FALSE}
topmajors |> gt()
```
```{r table2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
topmajors |> gt()
```
```{r table2-check}
grade_this_code()
```

So there you have it. You made a table. You're done, right? 

`gt` has a mountain of customization options. The good news is that it works in a very familiar pattern -- we start with data and we use |> to pipe to the next thing.

### Exercise 2: Fixing column names

We'll start with fixing headers. First, we have too many, so we're going to need to select just what we want to see -- the college name, the major name and then the total number of students with that major. Then, we're going to arrange our data in descending order by Total.

Lastly, we're going to rename `Major Name` and `Total`. What we have isn't bad, but they aren't good either. Let's fix that. The way this works is we need to tell `cols_label` what columns we want to change and what we want to change them into.

```{r table3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "table-load-data", message=FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |> 
  arrange(desc(Total)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    ____ = "Major",
    ____ = "Students"
  )
```
```{r table3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |> 
  arrange(desc(Total)) |>   
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    `Major Name` = "Major",
    Total = "Students"
  )
```
```{r table3-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Better. Note the pattern: Actual header name = "What we want to see". 

Now we can start working with styling. 

### Exercise 3: Styling, part 1

The truth is most of your code in tables is going to be dedicated to styling specific things. The first thing we need: A headline and some chatter. They're required parts of a graphic -- we'll talk more about that soon -- so they're a good place to start. We do that with `tab_header` and in there we need a title and subtitle.

```{r table4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "table-load-data", message=FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |> 
  arrange(desc(Total)) |>   
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    ____ = "Major",
    ____ = "Students"
  ) |>
  tab_header(
    ____ = "Top 20 majors at UNL",
    ____ = "Nebraska has 182 majors and most of them are small. Here's the big ones."
  )
```
```{r table4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |> 
  arrange(desc(Total)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    `Major Name` = "Major",
    Total = "Students"
  ) |>
  tab_header(
    title = "Top 20 majors at UNL",
    subtitle = "Nebraska has 182 majors and most of them are small. Here's the big ones."
  )
```
```{r table4-check}
grade_this_code()
```

We have a headline and some chatter, but ... gross. Centered? The extra lines? No real difference in font weight? We can do better. 

### Exercise 4: Changing typography

We can style individual elements using `tab_style`. First, let's make the main headline -- the `title` -- bold and left aligned. Then, we can left align the `subtitle`, but leave it normal weight (i.e. not bold).

```{r table5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "table-load-data", message=FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |> 
  arrange(desc(Total)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    ____ = "Major",
    ____ = "Students"
  ) |>
  tab_header(
    ____ = "Top 20 majors at UNL",
    ____ = "Nebraska has 182 majors and most of them are small. Here's the big ones."
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", weight = "bold", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("____")
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("____")
  )
```
```{r table5-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |> 
  arrange(desc(Total)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    `Major Name` = "Major",
    Total = "Students"
  ) |>
  tab_header(
    title = "Top 20 majors at UNL",
    subtitle = "Nebraska has 182 majors and most of them are small. Here's the big ones."
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", weight = "bold", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("title")
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("subtitle")
  )
```
```{r table5-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 5: Adding source and credit lines

The next item on the required elements list: Source and credit lines. In `gt`, those are called a `tab_source_note`:

```{r table6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "table-load-data", message=FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |> 
  arrange(desc(Total)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    ____ = "Major",
    ____ = "Students"
  ) |>
  tab_header(
    ____ = "Top 20 majors at UNL",
    ____ = "Nebraska has 182 majors and most of them are small. Here's the big ones."
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", weight = "bold", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("____")
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("____")
  ) |>
  ______________(
    source_note = md("**By:** Matt Waite  |  **Source:** University of Nebraska-Lincoln")
  )
```
```{r table6-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |>
  arrange(desc(Total)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    `Major Name` = "Major",
    Total = "Students"
  ) |>
  tab_header(
    title = "Top 20 majors at UNL",
    subtitle = "Nebraska has 182 majors and most of them are small. Here's the big ones."
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", weight = "bold", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("title")
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("subtitle")
  ) |>
  tab_source_note(
    source_note = md("**By:** Matt Waite  |  **Source:** University of Nebraska-Lincoln")
  )
```
```{r table6-check}
grade_this_code()
```

## More styling

We can do a lot with `tab_style`. For instance, we can make the headers bold and reduce the size a bit to reduce font congestion in the area.

```{r table7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "table-load-data", message=FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |> 
  arrange(desc(Total)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    `Major Name` = "Major",
    Total = "Students"
  ) |>
  tab_header(
    title = "Top 20 majors at UNL",
    subtitle = "Nebraska has 182 majors and most of them are small. Here's the big ones."
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", weight = "bold", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("title")
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("subtitle")
  ) |>
  tab_source_note(
    source_note = md("**By:** Matt Waite  |  **Source:** University of Nebraska-Lincoln")
  ) |>
  tab_style(
     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),
     style = list(
       cell_borders(sides = "bottom", weight = px(3)),
       cell_text(weight = "bold", size=12)
     )
   ) 
```
```{r table7-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |> 
  arrange(desc(Total)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    `Major Name` = "Major",
    Total = "Students"
  ) |>
  tab_header(
    title = "Top 20 majors at UNL",
    subtitle = "Nebraska has 182 majors and most of them are small. Here's the big ones."
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", weight = "bold", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("title")
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("subtitle")
  ) |>
  tab_source_note(
    source_note = md("**By:** Matt Waite  |  **Source:** University of Nebraska-Lincoln")
  ) |>
  tab_style(
     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),
     style = list(
       cell_borders(sides = "bottom", weight = px(3)),
       cell_text(weight = "bold", size=12)
     )
   ) 
```
```{r table7-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Next up: There's a lot of lines in this that don't need to be there. `gt` has some tools to get rid of them easily and add in some other readability improvements: `opt_row_striping` and `opt_table_lines`.

```{r table8, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "table-load-data", message=FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |>
  arrange(desc(Total)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    `Major Name` = "Major",
    Total = "Students"
  ) |>
  tab_header(
    title = "Top 20 majors at UNL",
    subtitle = "Nebraska has 182 majors and most of them are small. Here's the big ones."
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", weight = "bold", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("title")
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("subtitle")
  ) |>
  tab_source_note(
    source_note = md("**By:** Matt Waite  |  **Source:** University of Nebraska-Lincoln")
  ) |>
  tab_style(
     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),
     style = list(
       cell_borders(sides = "bottom", weight = px(3)),
       cell_text(weight = "bold", size=12)
     )
   ) |>
  opt_row_striping() |> 
  opt_table_lines("none")
```
```{r table8-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |>
  arrange(desc(Total)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    `Major Name` = "Major",
    Total = "Students"
  ) |>
  tab_header(
    title = "Top 20 majors at UNL",
    subtitle = "Nebraska has 182 majors and most of them are small. Here's the big ones."
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", weight = "bold", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("title")
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("subtitle")
  ) |>
  tab_source_note(
    source_note = md("**By:** Matt Waite  |  **Source:** University of Nebraska-Lincoln")
  ) |>
  tab_style(
     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),
     style = list(
       cell_borders(sides = "bottom", weight = px(3)),
       cell_text(weight = "bold", size=12)
     )
   ) |>
  opt_row_striping() |> 
  opt_table_lines("none")
```
```{r table8-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Throughout this series, we've been using color and other signals to highlight things. With a little `tab_style` magic, we can change individual rows and add color. The last `tab_style` block here will first pass off the styles we want to use -- we're going to make the rows red and the text white -- and then for locations we specify where with a simple filter. What that means is that any rows we can address with logic -- all rows with a value greater than X, for example, or all rows that match this college -- we can change the styling. 

```{r table9, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "table-load-data", message=FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |> 
  arrange(desc(Total)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    `Major Name` = "Major",
    Total = "Students"
  ) |>
  tab_header(
    title = "Top 20 majors at UNL",
    subtitle = "Nebraska has 182 majors and most of them are small. Here's the big ones."
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", weight = "bold", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("title")
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("subtitle")
  ) |>
  tab_source_note(
    source_note = md("**By:** Matt Waite  |  **Source:** University of Nebraska-Lincoln")
  ) |>
  tab_style(
     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),
     style = list(
       cell_borders(sides = "bottom", weight = px(3)),
       cell_text(weight = "bold", size=12)
     )
   ) |>
  opt_row_striping() |> 
  opt_table_lines("none") |>
  tab_style(
    style = list(
      cell_fill(color = "red"),
      cell_text(color = "white")
      ),
    locations = cells_body(
      rows = College == "Journalism & Mass Comm")
  )
```
```{r table9-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
topmajors |> 
  select(College, `Major Name`, Total) |> 
  arrange(desc(Total)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    `Major Name` = "Major",
    Total = "Students"
  ) |>
  tab_header(
    title = "Top 20 majors at UNL",
    subtitle = "Nebraska has 182 majors and most of them are small. Here's the big ones."
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", weight = "bold", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("title")
  ) |> tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "black", align = "left"),
    locations = cells_title("subtitle")
  ) |>
  tab_source_note(
    source_note = md("**By:** Matt Waite  |  **Source:** University of Nebraska-Lincoln")
  ) |>
  tab_style(
     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),
     style = list(
       cell_borders(sides = "bottom", weight = px(3)),
       cell_text(weight = "bold", size=12)
     )
   ) |>
  opt_row_striping() |> 
  opt_table_lines("none") |>
  tab_style(
    style = list(
      cell_fill(color = "red"),
      cell_text(color = "white")
      ),
    locations = cells_body(
      rows = College == "Journalism & Mass Comm")
  )
```
```{r table9-check}
grade_this_code()
```

We've arrived where we want to be: We've created a clear table that allows a reader to compare majors at will while also using color to draw attention to the thing we want to draw attention to. **We've kept it simple so the color has impact**.

## The Recap

Throughout this lesson, you've mastered the art of creating sophisticated tables using gt. You've learned to transform raw data into structured, easy-to-read tables by customizing headers, applying styles, and highlighting key information. Remember, effective tables strike a balance between informativeness and visual appeal. As you continue your data journalism journey, you'll find that well-designed tables can be powerful tools for presenting complex data in a format that's accessible to your audience. Keep experimenting with different styling options to find the perfect balance for your specific data and story needs.
